Mental health is an important issue and a healthy outlet is often helpful for emotional stability. However, it is understandable that people are not always comfortable confiding in others. To solve this issue, we created OutsideIn to prevent emotions from tearing you Inside Out. OutsideIn is a smart diary that analyzes your emotions in diary entries using Natural Language Processing from IBMâ€™s Watson API. After gathering this data, OutsideIn presents easy to understand visualizations of emotional trends presented in the diary entries.
